# DQN-BattleCityNes
Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning on simulated environment of BattleCity, an NES game.
The game environment is generated using the OpenAI Gym Retro Game Integration Tool. This tool generates a state file containing the two player start state, a JSON data file describing the game variables like enemies left, lives left, player 1 score, player 2 score.
Deep Q-Networks are used to perform the RL task to teach the agent to play the game successfully.
